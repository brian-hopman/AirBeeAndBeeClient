# AirBeeAndBeeClient


Inspired by my own experience with beekeeping and beekeepers, AirBeeAndBee connects
beekeepers to a national market, where they can sell their local honey.

AirBeeAndBee uses a Rails backend, and React frontend, along with parallax and
bootstrap for styling. Hosted on Heroku, a SQL database is  employed.
